# J.A.R.V.I.S
I thought it would be cool to create a personal assistant in Python. If you are into movies you may have heard of Jarvis, an A.I. based character in the Iron Man films. In this tutorial we will create a robot.  The features I want to have are:  Recognize spoken voice (Speech recognition) Answer in spoken voice (Text to speech) Answer simple commands, like sending E-mails, whatsapp messages,telling us weather, news etc etc
