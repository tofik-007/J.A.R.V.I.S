# J.A.R.V.I.S
I thought it would be cool to create a personal assistant in Python. If you are into movies you may have heard of Jarvis, an A.I. based character in the Iron Man films.  so, i create a robot.  The features it has :  Recognize spoken voice (Speech recognition) Answer in spoken voice (Text to speech) Answer simple commands, like sending E-mails, whatsapp messages,telling us weather, news etc etc
it can do multiple things like from the sending whatsappp messages to the opening youtube & play music for me. it would be cool to use differnet technologies like this in our daily life & make it more intresting.
this AI can tell us about weather of particular city with the help of fetched data through API.
it also includes the news from different sectors like sports, finance etc.
